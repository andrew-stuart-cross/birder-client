Angular 15 client app for the Birder website. 



## Add environment.ts file to compile

The development environment configuration file (environment.ts) is untracked.  You need to add the environment.ts file to a cloned copy of the repsository. This should be added to the environments folder and it should follow the same structure as the environment.prod.ts file which _is_ tracked in this repository.

## Fake REST API for testing

[json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) files which can be used to fake the Birder REST API are available on request (they are not tracked in this repository).
